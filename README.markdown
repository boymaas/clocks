# Clocks defines a webdsl on top of compojure

Implementation of a webdsl on top op compojure, uses ring, compojure and scriptjure as
serverside foundation, and jquery on the clientside.

Abstracts away most of the dependencies and most of the tedious boilerplate we all hate so much. 

## Usage

    (defblock my-reusable-interactive-block [param1 param2 param3 ...]
        ..code.. )

    (defpage my-interactive-page [param1 param2]
        [:html (block level1 []
               ..code...
               (blcok level2 []
                      ..code..
                      (block level3 []
                             ...code..
                             (callblock :my-reusable-interactive-block local-name-of-block))))

    (defroutes example
       (PAGE "/ajax-page" my-interactive-page))

`defpage` can be used to generate a page in which
blocks can be accessed independitly from the rest of the system.

This is implemented by scanning the source for special forms.

`block` indicates a piece of code which can be accessed via a seperate route.
these routes are defined by their path in the tree seperated by dots

`PAGE` clocks exports a new route parameter for clojure called `PAGE` which 
can be used to set a route to the page. For example:

       (PAGE "/" index)

Which will generate all the routes neccessary to render all individual blocks of code.


Routes and seperate functions are created to seperate blocks of functionality.
In this case level3 can be reached by sending a request to:

    /ajax-page.level1.level2.level3

and the complete page render at:
 
    /ajax-page

## Javascript and javascript macro's

See for more information `clocks/defjs` and `clocks/jquery`.

    ($id-on-event :login-form-email keyup
                 ($id-reload :validate {:email ($id-value :login-form-email)}))

## REUSABLE BLOCKS

Reusable blocks can be defined by `defblock`. These can be called with `callblock` from whithin
a page.

    (defblock name [params] ...)

These are called from withing a page using 

    (callblock name var-pointing-to-predefined-block)

# IMPLEMENTATION 

A short explanation of the implementations:

0. *expand callblock*
   for now all callblocks get expanded first, so the tree walker automaticly finds the correct
   paths and can create a function of them.

1. *extract special forms & register routes*
   code traverses the tree finding the special forms, currently `block` and `callblock`
   and stores them into a vector capturing all relevant informaiton including
   the path into the code.

2. *generate functions and routes*
   seperate functions are defined with a standard prefix so the namespace doesn't get polluted.

3. *generate routes*
   `(PAGE "route" page-id)` macro generates all the routes needed for the seperate blocks.

4. *per block session and parameter wrapping* special vars are introduced for the blocks and
   helper functions. Binding is done over the called block. Extra bindings can be provided
   wrapping the routes as usual using a ring handler. 
   `r* s* p* method* routes*`

For complete example see `examples/login.clj`.

    (defblock login-form [] 
      [:form {:id :login_form :method :post :url nil}

       (block login-form-fields [email password]
              [:input {:type :text, :id :login-form-email, :value email}]
              [:input {:type :password, :value password}])

       [:button {:id :login-form-submit}]] 

      [:div#login-form-messages]

      (block validate [email]
             [:h2 email]
             (if (not= email "boy")
               [:h3 "incorrect"]
               [:h3 "correct"]))

      (block validate-json [email]
             (str  (if (not= email "boy")
                     {:result true}
                     {:result false})))

      ($defjs

       ;; echo typed messages to div#login-form-messages
       ($id-on-event :login-form-email keyup
                     (var v this.value)
                     ($id-call :login-form-messages html

       ;; do some server-isde validation
       ($id-on-event :login-form-email keyup
                     ($id-reload :validate {:email ($id-value :login-form-email)}))

       ;; post a request via jquery to email
       ($id-on-event :login-form-submit click 
                     ($id-reload :login-form-fields {:email (. Math random)})
                     (return false))))

    (defpage index []
      [:html
       [:head
        (include-js "/jquery-1.4.2.min.js")]
       (block level1 [] ;; todo check on vector
              [:h1 "Clocks example"]
              [:h2 (block-uri :level1)]

              ;; expands :login-form defined block here ..
              (callblock :login-form login-form)

              ;; print defined routes in this page
              (block level2 []
                     [:ol (for [[k v] routes*]
                            [:li k "-->" [:a.pol {:href v} v]])]))

       (block page-output []
              "page output")]

      ;; do some jquery to load different blocks inside
      ;; the page-output block
      ($defjs
       (. ($ "a.pol") click (fn [event]
                              (var url this.href)
                              (. ($ "#page-output") load url)
                              (. event preventDefault)
                              (return false)))))
